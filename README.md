# Nurnisa Erismis  
Multilingual Translator • Linguistic Evaluator • AI Data Trainer

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I am a multilingual translator and writer working between **Greek (C1)**, **Turkish (native)**, **English (C1)**, **Western Armenian (intermediate)**, **Azeri**, and **Kurmanji Kurdish**.  
My work blends linguistic expertise, analytical thinking, and cross-cultural interpretation — a combination I now apply to **AI training, prompt engineering, and model evaluation**.

My professional background includes publishing essays on platforms such as **Keghart.org** and **Academia.edu**, translating culturally complex texts, and developing multilingual content with high stylistic sensitivity. I also interact with large language models daily: designing prompts, analyzing outputs, and refining responses for accuracy, nuance, and contextual alignment.
